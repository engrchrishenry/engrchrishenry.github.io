I am a PhD student working at the Multimedia Computing & Communication Lab with Prof. Zhu Li at the University of Missouri-Kansas City, USA. I interned at AtomBeam Technologies as an Intern Research Scientist/Consultant during Summer/Fall 2024. During Summer 2023, I interned at the Thales Group's Digital Identity and Security division in Pasadena, CA, USA under the supervision of Dr. Yi Ding. 

I earned my ME degree in 2019 from Gachon University, South Korea and BE degree in 2015 from Hamdard University, Pakistan. At Gachon University, I worked as a research assistant at the Pattern Recognition & Machine Learning Lab with Prof. Sang-Woong Lee. My research interests broadly include image processing, computer vision and deep learning.

During my free time, I love to play video games and watch memes.
